Angular 2 Skeleton App
=======================
This is just a little Angular 2 application I'm putting together for practice. It is supposed to help me learn the lyrics to the song "Go the Distance" from Disney's "Hercules."

It's also different from some of the other Angular 2 examples out there because I've used webpack instead of systemjs.
